The ability to visualise and predict where a species reside is important in conservation ecology. In this post, we'll explain the difference between two commonly used methods for graphically representing species distributions and show you how to create them using different data types! 

**Convex hulls** and **alpha hulls** are two types of spatial plotting methods which are used to describe the distribution of a particular species and [quantify IUCN metrics such as, Area of Occupancy and Extent of Occurrence](https://www.ala.org.au/spatial-portal-help/aoo/). Typically, convex and alpha hulls are used when dealing with **data deficient species** in conservation research.

Recently, [Dr. Marsh and colleages](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.13550) used alpha hulls to estimate the impact the 2020 mega bush fires on invertebrates in southern Australia. Since invertebrate data is inherently sparse, alpha hulls are really useful when you have a handful of records to work with. Dr. Marsh and their team found 13,581 invertebrate species had part of their range burnt during the megafires. Of these, 382 species had their entire known range burnt and a further 405 species had 50â€“99.9% of their range burnt!! This research study illustrates the magnitude of fire damage on a neglected taxonomic group and calls for drastic conservation action for all Australian invertebrates. We will actually be using an invertebrate species from Dr. Marsh's study in the walk-through below. 

Alpha hulls can also help researchers understand dynamic changes in species distributions. For example, distributions can shrink or expand due to habitat loss or in response to changing climate. [Dr. Takach and their team](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ddi.13145) used alpha hulls to investigate how  distributions of Australian tropical savanna mammals have changed over time. They compared alpha hulls of the [Black-Footed Tree Rat *Mesembriomys gouldii*](https://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/c6e1ff2d-ac80-4cc1-806c-6107e8e24617) from 2000 on wards to all the existing data for the species. They found that the Black-Footed Tree Rat experienced contemporary range contractions! While Dr. Takach 's team didn't show a plot of the alpha hulls in their research article, it's possible for us to reproduce one of their key results  using data from `{galah}`!

```

### Let's get started 
First we will install/load the R packages we'll need:

```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
# install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load(remotes, galah, tidyverse, alphahull, sp, sf, ozmaps, patchwork)
```

### An eye-catching example

We will use occurrence records of an endemic damselfly, *Austroargiolestes calcaris*, commonly known as the [Powdered Flatwing](https://bie.ala.org.au/species/https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/2d944503-2f03-48ec-8a8a-b78bc2b674af) to illustrate the various spatial polygons you can make

<center>![A Powdered Flatwing perched on a plant by Reiner Richter CC-BY 4.0](../static/polygons/Austroargiolestes_calcaris_1.jpeg){width="7.9cm"}</center>

Now let's use `galah` to download occurrence records from the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/). Note that you will need to first set up your own [ALA configuration locally](http://galah.ala.org.au/articles/download_data.html?q=config#configuring-galah) using `galah_config` before fetching records.

```{r, cache=TRUE, results='hide'}
#Download Powdered flatwing records 
galah_call() |> 
  galah_identify("Austroargiolestes calcaris") |> 
  galah_filter(profile="ALA") |> 
  galah_select(group = "basic") |> 
   atlas_occurrences() -> dfly
```

### Essential data cleaning 

Before we can plot anything, we need to remove all duplicated values and any NA values!

```{r, class.source = "fold-show"}
# De-duplication
dfly |> 
  filter(! duplicated(decimalLongitude) & ! duplicated(decimalLatitude)) |>  #Remove duplicates
  filter(! is.na(decimalLongitude) & ! is.na(decimalLatitude) ) -> dfly_clean # Exclude NA in coordinates
```

### Mapping a convex hull of ALA occurences

Put simply, a **convex hull** is a way to draw around all the points of a species on a map with as few lines as possible. It's defined as the smallest polygon that _encloses all the points_ in the data set

To plot a convex hull on a map: 

1. We start by using `chull()` to compute a convex hull from our cleaned Powdered Flatwing data. 
2. Then we will join the hull vector together to create an outline of the hull which can be plotted on a map. 
3. We will get a map of Australia from the `{ozmaps}` package  and set it a specific coordinate system. 
4. Now, we can plot our Powdered Flatwing occurrence records and its convex hull on a map! 


```{r, out.width = '90%', class.source = "fold-show"}
# 1. Compute convex hull
dfly_clean |> 
  select(decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude) |>  
  chull() -> dfly_chull

# 2. Create the outline of the hull but joining the hull vector together
dfly_chull_pts <- c(dfly_chull, dfly_chull[1])

# 3. Getting a polygon of Australia and set it to a specific coordinate system
aus <- st_transform(ozmaps::ozmap_country, 4326)

# 4. Plot the occurrences and convex hull
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aus, colour = "black", fill = "white")  + 
  geom_point(data = dfly_clean, aes(decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude), colour = "black", size = 0.8) + 
  geom_polygon(data = dfly_clean[dfly_chull_pts, ], aes(decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude), fill = "orange", colour = "black", alpha = 0.5) + 
  coord_sf(xlim=c(142, 152),ylim=c(-32,-44)) +
  labs(title = "Convex hull", x = "Longtitude (DD)", y = "Latitude (DD)") + ## DD here stands for decimal degrees
  theme_bw() -> dfly_chull_p

dfly_chull_p
```


### Mapping an Alpha hull of ALA occurrences
Alpha hulls have concave arced edges. They have an **alpha parameter** that controls the level of detail, or how tightly the boundary fits around the point set. The arched edges allow the shape to fit around the occurrence records more tightly.

To illustrate, here are three alpha hulls with _increasing_ values for alpha:

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE}
# 1.  Turn ALA occurrence data into a `sf` object 
dfly_sf <- st_as_sf(dfly_clean, coords = c("decimalLongitude", "decimalLatitude"), crs = 4326)

# 2. Compute alpha shapes and store in list column within a tibble
tibble(
  alpha_value = c(1, 2, 5),
  ahull_ls = map(.x = c(1, 2, 5),
                 .f = ~ dfly_clean |> 
                   select(decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude) |> 
                   ahull(alpha = .x)) 
) -> dfly_ahulls


# 2. Transform our `ahull` object into a `sp` object and set map projection to 4326
set_map_proj <- function(sp_obj){
sp_obj@proj4string <- sp::CRS("EPSG:4326") 

sp_obj
}

dfly_ahulls |> 
  mutate(ahull_sp = map(.x = ahull_ls,
                        .f = hull2spatial::ahull2poly),
         ahull_sp = map(.x = ahull_sp,
                        .f = set_map_proj)
         ) -> dfly_ahulls


# 3. Transform `sp` object into a `sf` object 
dfly_ahulls |> 
  mutate(ahull_sf = map(.x = ahull_sp,
                        .f = st_as_sf)
         ) -> dfly_ahulls

##  A function to compose map 
plot_ahull_fun <- function(ahull_sf, title = NULL){
  p <- ggplot() + 
    geom_sf(data = aus, colour = "black", fill = "white")  +
    geom_sf(data = dfly_sf, colour = "black", size = 0.5) +  
    geom_sf(data = ahull_sf, fill = "orange", alpha = 0.5) +
    coord_sf(xlim=c(142, 152),ylim=c(-32,-44)) +
    ggtitle(paste("a = ", as.character(title))) +
    labs(x = "Longtitude (DD)", y = "Latitude (DD)") + 
    theme_bw(base_size = 12)
  
  p
}

dfly_ahulls |> 
  mutate(ahull_maps = map2(.x = ahull_sf,
                           .y = alpha_value,
                           .f = ~ plot_ahull_fun(.x , .y)) 
  ) -> dfly_ahulls

wrap_plots(dfly_ahulls$ahull_maps)
```

Notice as the alpha value increases, the more simplified and fewer arches the alpha hull becomes. **Alpha = 2** is what we've most commonly come across in research, and is the value recommended by the IUCN for various forms of species vulnerability analysis, but choose your alpha values according to your needs.


### Using different data types {.tabset} 

Citizen science data are often excluded from scientific analyses due poor data quality e.g. rare species can be misidentified by a lay person. Below, we show you how you can plot your alpha hulls using all records vs. specimen online records.

#### Alpha hull using all types data

To make our alpha hulls, we will rely on an R package `hull2spatial` developed by Cecina Babich Morrow. Check out their [blog post](https://babichmorrowc.github.io/post/2019-03-18-alpha-hull/) about the package. This package allows us to convert `ahull` objects into ggplot-friendly objects. You can install the package using:
```{r, eval = FALSE, class.source = "fold-show"}
# install.packages("remotes)
remotes::install_github("babichmorrowc/hull2spatial")
```

To make and plot an alpha hull:

1. We'll start by taking our cleaned Powdered Flatwing records and turning it into an `sf` object. 
2. Then compute an alpha hull using the cleaned data.
3. After than, we will transform the alpha hulls into a `sp` object
4. Then transform the `sp` object into an `sf` object. 
5. Lastly, we will set our coordinates project system before plotting

```{r, class.source = "fold-show"}
# 1. Turn ALA occurrence data into a `sf` object
dfly_clean |> 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("decimalLongitude", "decimalLatitude"), crs = 4326) -> dfly_sf

# 2. Compute an alpha hull for our occurrences
dfly_clean |> 
  select(decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude) |> 
  ahull(alpha = 2) -> dfly_ahull

# 3. Transform our `ahull` object into a `sp` object
hull2spatial::ahull2poly(dfly_ahull) -> dfly_sp_df

# 4. Transform `sp` object into a `sf` object
dfly_sp_df |> 
  st_as_sf() -> dfly_sf_ahull

# 5. Set the coordinate system using `aus` object
dfly_sf_ahull %>% st_set_crs(st_crs(aus)) -> dfly_sf_ahull
```

```{r, out.width = '90%'}
# Plot the occurrences and alpha hull
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aus, colour = "black", fill = "white")  +
  geom_sf(data = dfly_sf, colour = "black", size = 0.5) +  
  geom_sf(data = dfly_sf_ahull, fill = "orange", alpha = 0.5) +
  coord_sf(xlim=c(142, 152),ylim=c(-32,-44)) +
  ggtitle("Alpha hull") +
  labs(x = "Longtitude (DD)", y = "Latitude (DD)") + 
  theme_bw() -> dfly_ahull_p

dfly_ahull_p
```

#### Alpha hull using specimen data 

Although a strict data criteria will reduce the number of data points, we can still compute and plot alpha hulls for the Powdered Flatwing - this is the beauty of them!

We are going to repeat the same steps for generating an alpha hull using for records that are linked to a specimen or photo. The only additional step is narrowing records using [`galah_filter()`](http://galah.ala.org.au/reference/galah_filter.html) to exclude  **citizen science data** before the data is downloaded.


```{r, cache=TRUE, results='hide', class.source = "fold-show"}
# Create a vector excluding human observations
institution_only <- c("PRESERVED_SPECIMEN", "LIVING_SPECIMEN", 
                   "MACHINE_OBSERVATION", "MATERIAL_SAMPLE")

galah_call() |> 
  galah_identify("Austroargiolestes calcaris") |> 
  galah_filter(basisOfRecord == institution_only,
               profile = "ALA") |> 
  galah_select(group = "basic") |> 
   atlas_occurrences() -> dfly_specionly
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Deduplication
dfly_specionly |> 
  filter(! duplicated(decimalLongitude) & ! duplicated(decimalLatitude)) -> dflysp_ddup

# Exclude NA in coordinates
dflysp_ddup |>  
  filter(! is.na(decimalLongitude) & ! is.na(decimalLatitude) ) -> dflysp_clean

# Turn ALA occurrence data into sf object
dflysp_clean |> 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("decimalLongitude", "decimalLatitude"), crs = 4326) -> dflysp_sf

# Compute an alpha hull for our specimen only occurrences
dflysp_clean |> 
  select(decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude) |> 
  ahull(alpha = 2) -> dflysp_ahull

# Transform our `ahull` object into a `sp` object and then into a `sf` object
hull2spatial::ahull2poly(dflysp_ahull) |> 
  st_as_sf() -> dflysp_sf_ahull

# Set the coordinate system using `aus` object
dflysp_sf_ahull %>% st_set_crs(st_crs(aus)) -> dflysp_sf_ahull
```

```{r, out.width = '90%', echo=FALSE}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = aus, colour = "black", fill = "white")  +
  geom_sf(data = dflysp_sf, colour = "black", size = 0.5) +  
  geom_sf(data = dflysp_sf_ahull, fill = "orange", alpha = 0.5) +
  coord_sf(xlim=c(142, 152),ylim=c(-32,-44)) +
  ggtitle("Specimen only alpha hull") +
  labs(x = "Longtitude (DD)", y = "Latitude (DD)") + 
  theme_bw() -> dflysp_ahull_p

dflysp_ahull_p
```


You'll notice with this map that there are **two separate hulls**! This is a benefit of an alpha hull over a convex hull. The mathematical constraints of a convex hull mean all points must be contained within a single polygon - this can lead to an over-estimation of range. 

### Final thoughts

While sophisticated tools for understanding species distribution exist, they require a substantial amounts of data to properly inform conservation research. **Convex polygons** and **alpha hulls** provide a flexible alternative, particularly for understudied species, to help us understand dynamic changes to their distributions.
